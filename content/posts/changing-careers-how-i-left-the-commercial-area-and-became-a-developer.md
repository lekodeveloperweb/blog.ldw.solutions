# A little bit of history‚Ä¶ {.my-4}

In mid-2011, still in the commercial career, working in the sales area in a company called Din√¢nimca Sistemas (acquired by AlterData a few years later), I can say that I acquired great knowledge, both in the personal department market, and how not to do things, but this is another story for another post. üòù

It was a decisive moment in my life, my daughter had just been born (Louyse 15/02/11), the sales market always had ups and downs, months with high sales commissions and others not so much, and in the past, had already thought about changing areas, but Could not. I started graduation in Business Administration and did not adapt, I moved to Accounting, because I always liked money (Who never? üòÅ), however, accounting for third-party money was not my goal.

It was at this time that I met my friend and mentor Leonardo Jaques, L√©o, I always thank him for what I am today and for the advice so valuable, that he had given me at the time and that still accompanies me to this day. Thank you! Count on me always! He discovered a talent, which until then, I didn't know, programming. It was common at that time, I do not know if it is still so, companies did not have robust software for commercial area / sales, as was the case of this company, right away I discovered one of the qualities that every programmer should have, Laziness. When I came across that archive of drop-down folders, I immediately asked myself:

> ‚ÄúUnable to search for sales history and customer relationship in this paperwork!‚Äù

That‚Äôs when it all really started.

I met with "The guy of marketing and project management", Leonardo Jaques, to draw up a plan to improve the sales and marketing strategy of the company and soon agreed that we should start with the automation and / or scanning of the process, that's when I mentioned that I worked very well with excel and that i had even done some dynamic spreadsheets with macros and VBA, yes VBA, I think the discovery of Leo came, I do not know, he will comment there in the post and will confirm me. For those who don't know.

> ‚ÄúVisual Basic for Applications (VBA) is an implementation of Microsoft‚Äôs Visual Basic embedded in all Microsoft Office programs - within this package are the famous Office applications, such as Visio, and which has also been incorporated at least partially into other third-party programs such as AutoCAD, Mathcad and WordPerfect. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications))‚Äú

So we started our journey as a pathfinder, it was a "Closed Forest", a lot of way to open with "blind machetes", I remember that we decided to change the sales strategy, because we had been hired to increase the company's profit, we started by understanding customers, organizing the house and developing a way to capitalize more on the business portfolio.{.pt-4}

At that time, if I remember correctly, Leo, was studying his MBA in project management, and so that you readers, understand how everything coincidentally fitted, he decided to put into practice what he was learning and called me to venture to create a sales system, to improve out process, and do not know if I commented, we worked in a software house, and we were about to create a system in parallel, which in the end we created, using limited resources, because it was not our area, so we could not request the resources for the same, and my simple and newly discovered, talent for programming. And as i couldn‚Äôt help but make the much-deserved tribute, the constructed system would be called Louyse Commercial Automation, created basically with VBA as programming language, Microsoft Access as a database and of course I can not help but mention here, a site full of material that helped me a lot at the time Usando Access, great Avelino Sampaio, we used the package Monta Ribbons to style our system, great learnings. üòÑ

It was there my first contact with Scrum, yes, as I said, Leo had already inserted the good design practices he had learned, look at the photo of our first kanban frame, entitled to Burn Down and all üòâ Thanks again, my friend, for eternizing this moment, Photo taken with the great warrior, Nokia C3.

From there, a lot changed, we really improved the sales process, we caused some intrigue, when we were discovered by by the development manager, Although he did not understand, at first, what was that frame full of post-its and graphics, the system worked and he began to ask yourself about if it was necessary. We used the network to store the ‚Äúsource code‚Äù and share the ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù, forgive us because we were beginners in programming, the director was satisfied with the efficiency in generating sales reports, even without knowing until today, how they were generated so fast and with such good appearance. We managed to unify the commercial assistant of telemarketing and marketing, improving the performance of my commercial visits and ending the peace of the real guys of üòÇ development, I did not comment that they worked with Delphi 4, and if it does not fail me memory, with the database "Paradox", which unintentionally, we found that we could import all this in Access, maximum security huh üòù.

If I remember correctly, we worried the development manager, when we found that there was a desire, a thought to migrate the database to MS SQL 2005, "beautiful thing!" It was the hook I needed to sell, and I sold it, announced to the four corners that we were releasing a modern and secure version of the system and was already in pre-sale and/or upgrade, customers loved it and the development sector **freaked out!!!**

> **A note**: Today I understand the suffering of the development crowd, but at that time, it was still 100% commercial, so, ‚Äúfriends, friends, business a part‚Äù‚Ä¶

In summary, I joined the university of Analyses and Development of System in August 2012, at Unicarioca university, I got an internship through the hitherto IT boy, who today is also a great friend of mine, Luan Santos, aka Santana, thank you for everything Santana, and the rest, I‚Äôll gradually tell you what changed from there to here, in future posts.

That is a little of my stories and I hope to share them even more with you, with time, my claim and to be able to make publications at least once a week. with varied topics between, Career, software development, daily life and some relevant facts of the day to day of a programmer. This is my first of many posts, I tried to be as brief as possible, to give an introduction of how was my transition from Commercial Manager to Developer, I hope you enjoyed, feel free to comment, share and any questions, I will always be available to answer, my social networks and email are always available.

A strong hug and success!!!
